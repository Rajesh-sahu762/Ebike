# 📖 Overview

EBikes Duniya is a complete multi-vendor electric bike marketplace designed to connect customers and electric bike dealers on a single platform.

The platform allows users to explore electric bikes, compare specifications, calculate EMI, save favorites, and send enquiries directly to dealers.

Dealers can manage their inventory, receive leads, and grow their business through a dedicated vendor dashboard.

Administrators have full control over users, dealers, bikes, approvals, and marketplace operations.
